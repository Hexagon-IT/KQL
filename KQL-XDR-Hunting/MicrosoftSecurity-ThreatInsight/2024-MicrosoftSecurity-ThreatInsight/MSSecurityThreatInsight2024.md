I have seen a variety of valuable insights on nation-based threat actors from MSTIC, DART, the Product Team, and others. While I may not be able to list them all precisely, I would like to keep them here as KQL query logs.

> [!Note]
> This repository primarily focuses on ***Threat Actors*** from the year 2024 , and therefore, does not include specific attack techniques.
> For details on each KQL, attack backgrounds, etc., please refer to the accompanying blog.

> [!Important]
> Microsoft has shifted to a new naming taxonomy for threat actors aligned with the theme of weather. With the new taxonomy, we intend to bring better clarity to customers and other security researchers already confronted with an overwhelming amount of threat intelligence data and offer a more organized, articulate, and easy way to reference threat actors so that organizations can better prioritize and protect themselves.
