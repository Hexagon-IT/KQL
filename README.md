KQL stands for "Kusto Query Language" and is a powerful language for hunting specific activities and data. Microsoft Sentinel (SOAR) and Microsoft 365 Defender (Advanced Hunting) are great examples of using KQL. However, leveraging KQL might be a bit challenging if you don't have SQL or programming background. When I started learning KQL, I had no idea how to begin as a learning process due to no programming/SQL experience. Throughout my KQL journey, I would like to share some of the best resources for learning KQL. At the same time, I would like to provide **"Hunting Queries"** in KQL-XDR-Hunting repository.

# KQL Webinar
