# KQL - learning resources
<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Azure-KQL-00B2FF.svg?logo=microsoftazure&style=popout">
KQL stands for "Kusto Query Language" and this is very effective when you want to hunt for specific activities and data. Also, Microsoft Sentinel (SOAR) and Microsoft 365 Defender (Advanced Hunting) are great examples for using KQL. However, leveraging KQL might be a bit challenging if you don't have SQL or programming background. When I have started learning KQL, I had no idea how to begin as a learning process due to no programming/SQL experience. Throughout my KQL journey, I would like to share some of the best resources for learning KQL. At the same time, I would like to share some sample queries in this KQL repository.

> Kusto Query Language is a powerful tool to explore your data and discover patterns, identify anomalies and outliers, create statistical modeling, and more. The query uses schema entities that are organized in a hierarchy similar to SQL's: databases, tables, and columns.

## Microsoft 365 Defender / Webcast 
This webinar was definitely helpful for people who are going to start learning KQL in Microsoft 365 Defender. Each series of webinar covers the fundamental KQL and the great use case. As I mostly focus on XDR in Microsoft 365 Defender in my work, I started watching these webinars initially.

Webcast 1 - 4 series 
1. [M365 Defender (MTP) webinar: Tracking the Adversary E1: KQL Fundamentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D9TkGjeJwM).
2. [M365 Defender (MTP) webinar: Tracking the Adversary E2: Joins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMrO6K5TWOU).
3. [M365 Defender (MTP) webinar: Tracking the Adversary, E3: Summarizing, Pivoting, and Visualizing Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKnk9U1NH6Y).
4. [M365 Defender (MTP) webinar: Tracking the Adversary E4 Letâ€™s hunt! Applying KQL to incident tracking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EUxOc_LNd8&list=RDCMUCGTUbqE3SJiLgtvWjIkSQuQ&index=3). <br>
