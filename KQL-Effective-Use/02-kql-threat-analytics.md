# Threat Analytics in Microsoft 365 Defender
At first, Threat Analytics provides you an in-depth overview of the cyberattack and even vulnerabilities. Especially, I would like to emphasize the excellent aspect of threat analysis - providing **"out-of-the-box hunting queries"** for you.

> Threat analytics is our in-product threat intelligence solution from expert Microsoft security researchers. It's designed to assist security teams to be as efficient as possible while facing emerging threats, such as: Active threat actors and their campaigns, Popular and new attack techniques, Critical vulnerabilities, Common attack surfaces and Prevalent malware.
