# Threat Analytics in Microsoft 365 Defender
At first, Threat Analytics provides you with an in-depth overview of cyber attacks and vulnerabilities. I would like to emphasize its excellent feature of providing **"out-of-the-box hunting queries"**, which are extremely helpful for identifying potential threats.

> Threat analytics is our in-product threat intelligence solution from expert Microsoft security researchers. It's designed to assist security teams to be as efficient as possible while facing emerging threats, such as: Active threat actors and their campaigns, Popular and new attack techniques, Critical vulnerabilities, Common attack surfaces and Prevalent malware.
