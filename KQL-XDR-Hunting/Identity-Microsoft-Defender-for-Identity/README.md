# Identity-related KQL queries
In this Identity KQL repository, I am delighted to share out-of-the-box Identity-related KQL queries based on Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Defender for Identity. 
I want to be respectful of the excellent work done by others, and while I aim to avoid duplication, there may be slight overlaps. 
To ensure comprehensive coverage of Identity-related queries, I will provide GitHub links, which I hope will be highly valuable for identity threat hunting.
